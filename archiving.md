# Archiving Policy

In June 2022, the DPGA introduced the concept of "archiving" to the DPG Registry. 

As of this date, nominated solutions that are inactive or do not provide the required documentation needed for review within 90 days of outreach will be moved into an "archived" state. Archived solutions can still be queried, and solutions can move from the archive to an active state by providing the information demonstrating that all requirements of the DPG Standard must be met. 

Once a year, all digital public goods will have their documentation re-reviewed by the DPGA to ensure requirements are still met. Nominees have not yet been reviewed against the DPG Standard, or may currently be undergoing review. Digital solutions that are no longer active, or do not provide the required documentation needed for review, will be moved into the archive.
